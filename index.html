          <h1>NYT Strands Stats</h1>
          <p>
            In the Summer of 2025, I was an intern at NYT Games. During that
            time, I contributed to pushing out the Strands Stats and Streaks
            feature, where we track player progress and statistics such as
            completion rate, rate of completion without using hints, and streaks
            to display to the player.
          </p>

      <h2>Strands Welcome Screen</h2>
      <section class="breakout">
        <img class="image small" src="assets/progress-1.png" alt="" />
        <img class="image small" src="assets/progress-2.png" alt="" />
        <img class="image small" src="assets/progress-3.png" alt="" />
        <p style="max-width: 1100px; margin: 0 auto;">
          One of my earliest tasks was to create a dynamic welcome screen for Strands that
          would display the player's progress on their daily puzzle. A different progress icon
          and text would be displayed depending on how many words a player has found. I wrote custom
          redux selectors to fetch the necessary player data, as well as adding unit tests to verify
          proper rendering, and Storybook controls to see the variety of progress states and maintain
          our component driven development.

      <h2>Strands Completion Screen</h2>
      <section>
        <img class="image" src="assets/congrats.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          For the Strands completion screen, I added a display where the player can see a row of their statistics
          on Strands. This completion screen is dynamic based on the user state of the player. For example, if the player
          is not registered, instead of displaying statistics, we display a registration CTA which encourages players to
          register to see their unique statistics.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Strands Statistics Display</h2>

        <p>
          Lastly, was displaying the statistics themselves. Collaborating with other engineers on this task, I learned how we
          store and track player statistics through a Golang pipeline to a database, incrementing stats such as "Spangram Firsts"
          and "No Hints" when the player enters the Strands player or finishes a puzzle. Lastly, I added a dismissable message that
          notifies players about the new Strands stats feature. This message uses local storage to ensure the user sees the message
          at least twice before it disappears.
